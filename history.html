      This is where and this is how the story of Strugar shoes begins: <br>
In the very heart of the City of Zagreb, in its historical part <br> named 'Lower town', at Ilica the main street, a small salon was <br> situated back in 1967, which has neither spread out over time <br> spatially nor changed location, but the reputation about it has <br> spread beyond the City itself.

    It is located in the courtyard beside the then satirical cabaret Jazavac (today's Kerempuh Theater), which was founded only a few years earlier, also <br> not far from the Cathedral itself, the main Square, from the most famous marketplace Dolac, and the historically significant Manduševac, the spot <br> where, according to the legend, a girl called Manda GRAB from the water well, after which event the City got its name. All in all, it is located where the <br> history of the City of Zagreb is written. In the same year the salon was founded, the city football club Dinamo, after excellent games, won the Fair Cities <br> Cup (later the UEFA Cup, today's UEFA Europa League). In this ambience and under the ownership of the Strugar family, the salon commenced its <br> activities and continued without closing or business interruptions until today. From that time until now, the salon is the symbol of an urban style linked <br> with the old tradition of the City of Zagreb.

    In the year 1967, the entrepreneur Alojz Strugar started the shoemaking tradition of the Strugar family, investing his hard work, knowledge, proficiency,<br> and taste in fashion, which did not fall behind the leading fashion brands of that time.

      Long tradition in craft
    </p>
    <p class="podtekst">
      It is one of the few stores left that exudes the spirit of <br> Zagreb's small crafts. The craft tradition in Zagreb has a <br> rich history dating back to the Middle Ages. The <br> beginning of economic development even then were <br> tradesmen-artisans, who had their unions and guilds,<br> which, adhering to strict rules, became the basis of <br> manufacturing production. Even though there is not as <br> many such crafts today, the centre of Zagreb still <br> resists. The Strugar salon is one of the few stores that <br> has survived thanks to the quality and the good image <br> it gained. The Strugar shoes created its own tradition <br> using the acquired inside knowledge and knowhow <br> made through the years.

  <p class="podtekst1">
    In addition to the traditional features of our salon, on the basis of which the entire business was founded and profiled, the modern needs of clients <br>  have also been considered and accepted, and new fashion trends were and are taken into account. As a consequence, the business was permanently <br> raised to new levels, and new fashion styles were added to our models. <br>
In the long tradition of the Strugar family business, those shoes were often worn and appreciated by many distinguished artists, athletes and <br> politicians, such as Zlatko Dalić, Croatian famous football coach and former football player, and Jasmin Stavros, late famous singer and artist. Many of <br> customers, known or unknown, regularly visit the store.
